"this" keyword:
    "this" is a keyword like "class", "void". It is used in many places. For example,
    if we have same name instance and local variable, we can use "this" to explicitly refer to instance variable.
    We can use "this()" to call a constructor inside another constructor.

Why should we learn about "this" keyword:
    1)it allows us to have same name local and instance variables.
    2)if we have same code in two constructors we can reuse that code from one constructor inside another constructor
    by writing "this()".

Inheritance:
    Inheritance is a mechanism in java through which we can use the fields/methods of
    one class inside another class.

Why should we learn inheritance?
    It allows to reduce the duplicate code.

How many types of inheritance are there?
    1)single
    (In single inheritance, we have only 1 parent and 1 child class.)
    2)multilevel
    (In multilevel inheritance, we have inheritance in multiple levels like we have
    a grandfather--> father --> son --> grandson
    3)hierarchical
    (one parent class and multiple direct child classes.)
    4)Multiple inheritance:
    (one child class can directly inherit from multiple parent classes. It is not supported bu java
    because of diamond problem.)



    Constructors cannot be inherited
    Super keyword only work when there is parent child relation, when we use inheritance
    This keyword can be used inside the same class

What is the syntax?
    We can use this feature by writing extends keyword when declaring a class.
