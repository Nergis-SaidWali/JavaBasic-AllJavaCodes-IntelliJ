Exceptions:
    It's an unwanted behaviour that occurs at run time and disturbs the normal flow of the program.

Why we should learn about exception?
    1)We can use exception to figure out the exact line of code and also get an explanation about that error.
    2)To convert complex system generated error messages to something that everyone can understand.
    3)When we are building application for other users like Google Chrome, Discord, Zoom etc. We can use
    exception handling to improve the user experience. When we handle exception applications no longer terminate abruptly.

What is the syntax?
    We can handle exceptions using try catch block.
    We can also utilize finally block and we use some new keywords like throw and throws.

try-catch block:
    try{
    //the code that might cause some problems
    }catch(The name of the class whose exception we are expecting){
    //Back up code or the code that we want to execute in case the code in try block fails.
    }finally{
    //the code that we want to execute no matter what happens in try or catch block.
    //For example closing the critical resources like files releasing database connection etc.
    }

    *if we have a checked exception, we can't use it unless and until we use try catch block.

Throw keyword:
    We use the throw keyword to throw the exceptions.

throws keyword:
    When we want to avoid writing a try catch block, we can use throws keyword with method header to
    throw this responsibility to the caller of the method.
    When we are feeling tired and don't want to do any work on job, so we use throws keyword.

    *e.printStackTrace : is used to print the path to the error and also a simple message that explains the error
