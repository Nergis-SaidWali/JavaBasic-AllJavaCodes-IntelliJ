        HashTable:
            HashTable is previous version of HashMap. HashTable is thread safe. It uses synchronization
            to achieve that safety and because of this it is slow as compared to HashMap.
        Why should we not use HashTable:
            As a Tester, it is very rare that we will be writing multi threaded code anf if you don't write multi threaded
            code but still use HashTable, it will make our code slow for no benefit.

        Difference between HashMap and HashTable:
            HashTable is thread safe while HashMap is not.

        Maps:
            How can we iterate through a map.

Important Concepts for your coding tests:
if else conditions
loops
arrays
String class methods
ArrayList
Maps

Important concepts for verbal interviews:
OOPS

For frameworks:
1)How classes work for example hpw to create a class, how to declare instance variables, how to use them inside methods
2)Go through all the concepts of methods
3)Types of variables like, instance/static(you will be using heavily)
4)inheritance
5)ArrayList and Maps


FileHandling in Java:
    Reading, writing and manipulating files.

Why we should learn about file handling?
    1)We don't store the sensitive data inside the code. It might get exposed when we push the code to GitHub.
    2)Hardcoding the data or credentials is a very bad practice. because for any reason if your have to change the credentials,
    or that data, you will have to change it everywhere which will take a lot of time.
    3)When we have to perform data driven testing, we use a lot of data to perform this type of testing and it is not
    feasible to put all of that data in code.

Steps to read from any file in Java:
    1)First, we need the location(path)
    2)Use a class to navigate to that location(For example FileInputStream)
    3)We need a class that can help us read/write data to that special type of file (for example for .properties file
    we use Properties class and for excel, we use XSSFWorkBook class.
