What is inheritance?
    It's mechanism through which a class can inherit the properties and methods of another class.

Why we should learn inheritance:
    It helps use avoid code duplication.
    It helps us save space.
    It helps us improve the execution speed.

What is the syntax?
    We use extends keyword and name of the class from which we want to inherit the fields and methods while declaring
    the class.

Types of inheritance:
    There can be 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them with classes.
    1) Single
When we have only one parent and one child class in inheritance its called single inheritance. Not widely used.

    2) Multilevel
One top level and one base class and many intermediate classes. For example; A<B<C<D

    3) Hierarchical
When we have one parent and multiple child classes, its called Hierarchical.

    4) Multiple (it is not supported by classes in Java)
One child and multiple parent classes. It is not supported by classes in Java. It is because of the diamond problem.


Super keyword:
    We use the super keyword to explicitly call the variable from the parent class when we have same name instance
    variable in child class and parent class.
    We can also use the super keyword to call the constructor of the parent class.


Method Overloading:
    Method overloading allows us to create multiple methods in a class with same name.

Why we should create multiple methods with same name?
    It gives the end user flexibility.
    The end user can call the same method with diffirent parameters to get the same or different results.

How do we overload a method?
    1)By passing different number of parameters.
    2)By changing the dataType.
    3)By changing the order.
