Exception:
    Exceptions are unwanted behaviors which occurs during runtime and can terminate programs or can change
    the normal behavior of a program.

Why should we handle exceptions?
    1)When we handle exceptions, it leads to a very good user experience.
    2)We can read the error messages and can figure what we are doing wrong.
    3)When we handle the exceptions properly, only the problematic code will not execute, the rest of the code will still
    continue to work.

How to handle the exceptions?


Types of exceptions because someone wrote bad code is called Unchecked exceptions-lightweight exceptions,
the exceptions for which Java will not force you. They can be avoided by just writing better code.
