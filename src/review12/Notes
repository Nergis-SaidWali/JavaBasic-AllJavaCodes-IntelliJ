Collections Framework:
    is a set of classes and interfaces that help us store and manipulate data.
Why we need collections framework?
    1)Flexibility
    2)Read-made methods
    3)Same classes and methods can be with different data types.
Some common classes:
    1)ArrayList,
    2)LinkedList,
    3)HashSet,
    4)LinkedHashSet,
    5)TreeSet
Some common interfaces:
    1)List,
    2)Set
List:
    1)Lists like ArrayList and LinkedList maintains the insertion order.
    2)They allow duplicates.
Set:
    1)They do not allow duplicate values.
ArrayList vs LinkedList:
    When most of the time, we retrieve data (get()) we should use ArrayList as it is very fast to retrieve index
    based data as underlying datastructures is an array.
    When most of the time, we manipulate the data(adding removing shifting) add() remove()



Note:In an array a data is stored in consecutive memory location, in a straight line! Shifting needed
if we want to add or remove something, then computer needs to do a lot of work.

Note: For your coding interviews, you will always get;
1)if-else condition
2)loops
3)arrays
4)String class
5)maps
6)ArrayList

HashSet vs LinkedHashSet vs TreeSet

    We should always go with the HashSet because it is fastest of all and requires less memory.
    Like for example, when we go to KFC, the customers who order first should be processed first,
    we should use LinkedHashSet.
    if we are working on applications that requires us to sort data like phonebooks and dictionaries
    we should use TreeSet.

Maps:
    Whenever we have to store key value pairs for example: items and their prices, username-password,
    cities and their zip codes, we should use maps.
