        HashTable:
            HashTable is previous version of HashMap. HashTable is thread safe. It uses synchronization
            to achieve that safety and because of this it is slow as compared to HashMap.
        Why should we not use HashTable:
            As a Tester, it is very rare that we will be writing multi threaded code anf if you don't write multi threaded
            code but still use HashTable, it will make our code slow for no benefit.

        Difference between HashMap and HashTable:
            HashTable is thread safe while HashMap is not.

        Maps:
            How can we iterate through a map.
