Method Overriding:
    Allows us to have same name method in parent and child classes.

Why we should override a method?
    Let's say we are inheriting from a parent class that has 10 methods. We like 8 of them and we want to reuse those methods
    but we don't like 2 of them, we want to provide implementation in a different way. We can use method overriding to override
    those methods.

What is the syntax to override a method:
    We simply redefine the method in the child class.
